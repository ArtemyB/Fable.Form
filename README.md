# Fable.Form



## The secret pun

Naming library is super annoying.

To make it easy to discover, in general, you need to choose a simple and clear name. Especially in a "small" ecosystem like Fable.

But, it is possible spice thing up for this reason `Fable.Form` stands for `Fable.Formidable`.

## Original implementation

Fable.Form has been inspired by [hecrj/composable-form](https://github.com/hecrj/composable-form) library. The code has been ported from Elm to F# and then I adapted it to my vision of how a form should behave.
