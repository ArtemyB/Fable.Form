Fable.Form allows you to build forms that are:

- **Composable:** they can be extended and embedded in other forms
- **Type safe:** makes the most of F# compiler to tied everything
- **Scalable:** you don't need a `Msg` for each field neither repeat your `view` code
- **Terse:** your field logic is defined in a single place
- **Modular:** you can create your own fields and customize how existing fields are rendered
